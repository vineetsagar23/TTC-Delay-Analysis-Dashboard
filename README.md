# TTC-Delay-Analysis-Dashboard

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard for analyzing delays in the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) system. The dashboard is based on a dataset from 2022 and covers over 27,000 delay incidents.

The dashboard includes several visualizations that showcase the frequency and duration of delays, as well as the most common reasons for them. The exhaustive reasons for delays that are included in dashboard are: 
- Cleaning - Disinfection, 
- Cleaning - Unsanitary,
- Collision - TTC,
- Diversion,
- Emergency Services,
- General Delay,
- Held By,
- Investigation,
- Late Entering Service,
- Mechanical,
- Operations - Operator,
- Road Blocked - NON-TTC Collision,
- Security,
- Utilized Off Route,
- Vision.

The analysis reveals that the most common reason for delays is Operations - Operator issues, which total accounted for about ~35% of all incidents. The second most common reason was " Mechanical " which accounts to ~30% of delay. Combined, the top two reasons account for approximately 55% of all instances of delay.

The analysis has also uncovered a key finding that three other issues are directly linked to passenger safety. These issues are:
- Collision - TTC : 6.67%
- Security : 5.82% 
- Emergency Services : 4.07%

These incidences account to a total of 16.56% which is a significant concern that should be addressed by authorities. The dashboard also drills down into the top 10 routes where these incidents occurred to identify commonalities and study their root causes.

Furthermore, the dashboard's second half features an interactive interface that allows users to navigate between different routes and review essential information through charts, including:
- Incidents and Weekday Stack Chart
- Incident Percentage By Day Table
- Top 5 Reasons of Incident
- Top 5 Incident - Highest Average Time Delayed

This dashboard is designed to help TTC riders understand the reasons behind delays and identify areas for improvement. It can also be useful for TTC employees and stakeholders who want to gain insights into the TTC system's performance.

The Tableau workbook and the underlying dataset are available in this repository. The workbook contains instructions on how to connect to the data and customize the visualizations for your own purposes.

Feel free to explore the dashboard and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for your interest in my project!
